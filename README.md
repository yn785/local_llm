## Text Processing and Generation Pipeline

This project demonstrates the use of several libraries and tools for text processing, embedding, and generating responses using a pre-trained language model. The steps include loading and splitting PDF documents, embedding the text, and generating responses based on similarity search results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Libraries: `langchain`, `sentence-transformers`, `transformers`, `huggingface_hub`, `chromadb`, `tqdm`

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install langchain sentence-transformers transformers huggingface_hub chromadb tqdm
```
